I'm an osu!std player currently placed sub 80K in the global leaderboard.

I'll most likely maintain only one single repo which will feature my osu! skins.

If I ever happen to be bored enough I might start a few small learning projects 
most likely revolving around lua cuz it always interested me for some reason.
Don't expect me to jump into learning it anytime soon tho.
